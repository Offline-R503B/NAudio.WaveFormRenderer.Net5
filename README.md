# NAudio.WaveFormRenderer (PORTED BY OFFLINE TO NET5)
Simple utility to render waveforms of audio files to PNGs. Uses [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/naudio) to extract the peaks and `System.Drawing` to render the images.

The project contains the `WaveFormRendererLib` library which performs peak calculation and waveform rendering, along with a simple test harness WinForms application to try it out with different settings. This can be used in any project that is able to take a dependency on NAudio and System.Drawing. It can be used in WinForms or WPF apps, or within ASP.NET applications to generate server side waveform images.

The waveform rendering algorithm is customizable:

 * Supports several peak calculation strategies (max, average, sampled, RMS, decibels)
 * Supports different colors or gradients for the top and bottom half
 * Supports different sizes for top and bottom half
 * Overall image size and background can be customized
 * Transparent backgrounds
 * Support for SoundCloud style bars
 * Several built-in rendering styles

## Test Harness Application
Test harness app makes it easy to experiment with the various rendering options and save the results as a PNG.
